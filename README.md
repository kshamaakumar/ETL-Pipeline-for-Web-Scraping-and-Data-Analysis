ETL Pipeline for Web Scraping and Data Analysis

Create an ETL pipeline to scrape data from a news website and perform data analysis on the collected articles. The target website will be "Google News" (https://news.google.com/). Collect the article titles, publication dates, and article links
Execution Steps: 

1.	Choose the Target Website: 
o	Website: BBC News (https://news.google.com/)
o	Data to Collect: Article titles, publication dates, and article categories.
2.	Web Scraping: 
o	Tools: Python, Beautiful Soup/Scrapy , requests library.
o	Use the requests library to send an HTTP request to the website and get the HTML content of the page.
o	Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup to extract the relevant data (article titles, publication dates, and categories) using appropriate HTML tags and classes.
--> 3.	Data Transformation: (In progress)
    o	Tools: Python (Pandas for data manipulation).
    o	Create a DataFrame to store the scraped data.
    o	Clean the data by handling any missing or incorrect values, removing duplicates, and converting data types if necessary.
    o	Extract the publication date and format it to a standardized date format.
4.	Data Storage: 
o	Tools: SQLite database (Python's sqlite3 library).
o	Set up a SQLite database to store the cleaned data.
o	Create a table in the database to hold the article data with appropriate columns for article titles, publication dates, and categories.
o	Insert the cleaned data from the DataFrame into the database table.
5.	Data Analysis: 
o	Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
o	Load the data from the SQLite database into a DataFrame.
o	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the collected data using Pandas for statistical insights, data summaries, and visualizations.
o	Generate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand trends and patterns in the articles.
6.	Visualization: 
o	Tools: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
o	Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create interactive visualizations to present the analysis results.
o	For example, you can create a bar chart showing the distribution of articles across different categories or a time series plot showing the number of articles published over time.
7.	Automate the Pipeline: 
o	Tools: Python, Apache Airflow (for automation).
o	Develop a Python script that encapsulates all the above steps from web scraping to data analysis.
o	Set up an Apache Airflow workflow to schedule and automate the execution of the script at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).
8.	Documentation and GitHub: 
o	Document each step in the README file with clear explanations and code samples.
o	Upload the code to your GitHub repository, ensuring it is well-organized and easy to navigate.
o	Include proper code comments and commit messages for better collaboration and understanding.
